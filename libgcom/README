----------

This is a C++ library for interfacing with 3D printers such as RepRaps and
Makerbots.  It is meant as a way to separate out some of the functionality
of ReplicatorG, the current control software, so that it is easier for
developers to create their own user interfaces and other tools.  This library
is written in C++ so that it can run natively without the need for any runtimes
which might prevent it from being run on low-memory computers such as hacked
wifi routers or other such devices.  It is also my hope that separating out
the control software will allow developers to use it inside design software
(such as putting a 'print' command directly into Blender or OpenSCAD).
